As part of my leadership role with the University of Rochester's sports analytics club, I developed and led two coding tutorials for our club.
For the first tutorial, I created an expected swinging strike model in R for MLB pitchers to demonstrate the process of cleaning data, visualization, 
and modeling. The code can be found here: [URSAC Swinging Strike Tutorial](https://github.com/ajaypatel-8/URSAC-R-Tutorial). 

For the second tutorial, I focused on data manipulation and visualization in R, extracting key insights to 2024's Super Bowl matchup using data
from nflfastR. The tutorial can be found here: [URSAC Super Bowl Tutorial](https://github.com/ajaypatel-8/URSAC_SuperBowl).

Using pitch-level data from MLB, I developed visualization reports in R utilizing the ggplot2 and gt packages to summarize a starting pitcher's 
outing. To my knowledge, I was one of the first to create such reports in the public sphere. Information on their locations, pitch movement, 
and results are effectively communicated, and my initial versions can be found at the following tweets: [Initial Pitcher Summaries](https://x.com/ajaypatel8_/status/1648836638825480193). 

Since then, I refined different aspects of the reports. Below is a more recent and finalized version.

The code to make these reports can be found here: [Pitcher Summaries Code](https://github.com/ajaypatel-8/Baseball-Plots/blob/main/pitcher_game_summary.R).

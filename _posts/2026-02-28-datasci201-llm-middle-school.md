For my UC Berkeley MIDS DATASCI 201 final project, our team studied how large language models can be integrated into 8th-grade science classrooms in New Jersey to improve comprehension rather than encourage misuse. We focused on how guided use of an education-focused model (KhanMigo) compares with unguided use of general-purpose free LLMs.

The design used stratified sampling across 50 New Jersey public schools, with a control group (free public LLM access) and an intervention group (KhanMigo plus teacher guidance). We planned to evaluate pre/post NJSLA science outcomes, prompt usage patterns, and qualitative survey/interview feedback from students, teachers, parents, and administrators. Our analysis plan included t-tests, ANOVA subgroup comparisons, linear regression on score improvement, NLP-based response quality evaluation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank testing for paired survey changes.

Our goal was to produce actionable recommendations for the NJ Board of Education around AI literacy, prompt guidance, and classroom implementation guardrails. We also documented key limitations, including teacher-effect confounding, subject-specific generalizability, and separating model effects from guidance effects.

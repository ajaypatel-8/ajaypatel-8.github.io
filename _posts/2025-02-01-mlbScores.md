Using MLB's API, I developed a website utilizing React and Javascript to display MLB scores and relevant information for completed games, 
and preview information for upcoming games. The site is deployed through Github Pages and can be found [here](https://ajaypatel-8.github.io/mlb-games/).

Below is an example of what a day's worth of games would look like on the site. It supports functionality to view top performers, pitchers
who recorded decisioins, and summaries for all players along with links to Baseball Savant's game feed and MLB.com's recap article.

<div style="text-align: center;">

The code for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/ajaypatel-8/mlb-games)

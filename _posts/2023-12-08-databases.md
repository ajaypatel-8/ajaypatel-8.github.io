As part of my undergraduate coursework, Tochi Onwuasoanya and I created a Flask app hosting hypothetical basketball data through MySQL, using
HTML and CSS to design the site. The goal of this project was to create a full-stack website, where we got experience with all parts of the 
data engineering pipeline. Our code to create the project can be found here: [Databases Final Project](https://github.com/Tochi-Onwuasoanya/Milestone3).

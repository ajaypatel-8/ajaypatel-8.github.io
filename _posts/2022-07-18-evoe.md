I developed an adjusted exit velocity metric for hitters and pitchers that accounts for the quality and location of the pitch seen to further isolate power as a skill for hitters, and damage prevention for pitchers. I utilized a XGBoost model to do so, and detailed the full process here: [EVOE Explainer](https://medium.com/@ajaypatell8/exit-velocity-over-expected-a-dive-into-hitting-the-ball-hard-48176454c6b). I also published a Shiny app that can be found here [EVOE Shiny App](https://ajaypatel8.shinyapps.io/EVOE/) that hosts the data along with a few insightful visualizations.

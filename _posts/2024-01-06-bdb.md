This was my group's project to the 2024 NFL Big Data Bowl. We created a novel tracking data based model for expected yards after catch using a convolutional neural network with an Adam optimizer through PyTorch. Additionally, we combined framework from Open Source Football to use our predicted values to generate xYAC based expected points for each play in our dataset. Our submission was on the coaching track, and we placed as runner-up out of hundreds of submissions.

Our code for the project can be found here: [xYAC BDB Code](https://github.com/luckyprophet5/bdb-2024-xyac).

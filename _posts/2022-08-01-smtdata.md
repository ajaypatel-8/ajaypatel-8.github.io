This was Ben Wieland and I's submission to the 2022 SMT Data Challenge. We tackled minor league defense, particularly outfield defense, by measuring route efficiency and developing an Outs Above Average model utizling given tracking data. Route efficiency was calculated using distance formula calculations and OAA through three logistic regression models. Our full write up can be found here: (insert paper pdf). Our code can also be found here: [SMT Data Challenge Code](https://github.com/bbwieland/smt-data)

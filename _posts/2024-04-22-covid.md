As part of my undergraduate coursework, Jared Coffey and I analyzed how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the state of Ohio. We first
conducted descriptive analysis, calculating Jaccard similarity-based awareness values for different relevant topics and plotting the 
distributions of cases and deaths over time. We then created a predictive model using a gradient boosted regressor to predict COVID
cases over time. Our model achieved a 0.9364 R-squared value, which was the second-highest in the undergraduate division of our course.
We also published a report for the project, which can be found here (pdf here).

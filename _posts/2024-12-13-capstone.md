As part of my undergraduate coursework, I completed a capstone project with a group analyzing statements of purpose submitted to our school's Master's of Data Science program. Our task was to determine if they played a role in admissions, and whether any meaningful relationships could be found. We utilized sentiment and emotion analysis to extract meaning from the essays and tested correlation to admission along with it as a feature in predicting admission, through various modeling techniques including logistic regression and tree-based models. Our final presentation can be found here: [GIDS Capstone Presentation](https://github.com/ajaypatel-8/ajaypatel-8.github.io/blob/master/Final%20Presentation.pdf).

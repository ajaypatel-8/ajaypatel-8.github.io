title:  "Pitch Usage By Time Through The Order"
layout: post

I created a Streamlit app that hosts data on how pitchers change their pitch usage depending on the time through the opposing lineup. My hypothesis
was that certain pitchers change their usage more than others, and some should be changing their usage a little more, but it was awfully 
annoying to check individually, which led to me making the app. Information on pitch usage, performance, and characteristics can be found within it.
The app is hosted here: [Pitch Usage Streamlit](https://pitchusage.streamlit.app). The code for the app can be found here: [Pitch Usage Code](https://github.com/ajaypatel-8/PitchUsage/tree/main).

Welcome to my personal website! I'm a current Junior Data Scientist with the Pittsburgh Pirates and Master of Information and Data Science student at UC Berkeley. I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Data Science from the University of Rochester in December, 2024. In the past, I've worked in data and analytics roles with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Optum, and ShotQuality.

My work focuses on applied machine learning and data-driven decision-making, with a particular emphasis on baseball data. I've also published a few public projects and analyses, which you can explore here.
